My favorite arcade game has always been pinball. It probably comes from growing up with that [Sesame Street pinball cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOaZbaPzdsk) that taught me to count to 12.

Did you know there are 6 establishments in downtown Olympia that have pinball machines in them? Here is your flipper finder map to having a pinball night on the town.

All these pinballs are 50 cents to play. Except Hannah's, they charge $1 per play

## Jakes

[Jakes on 4th](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jake's+On+4th,+311+4th+Ave+E,+Olympia,+WA+98501/@47.0448874,-122.8985528,17z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x5491751eaf246da7:0x1b03683fff8aebe9!2sJake's+On+4th,+311+4th+Ave+E,+Olympia,+WA+98501,+United+States!3m1!1s0x5491751eaf246da7:0x1b03683fff8aebe9?hl=en) has a single pinball machine and it's Metallica! Had a lot more fun in Jakes than I expected because of this wonderful game.

You know what makes a pinball game popular? Sometimes it's just the theme. 

## The BroHo

They also have a hand shuffleboard table too which is sometimes fun too.

## 4th Ave Tav

They also have one called Getaway. 

## Old School Pizzeria

Their games are Road Show, Hook, and Whirlwind. The only complaint I have about their games though is they don't feel very level and are a little cramped.


## Hannah's
<img alt="Ghostbusters" src="/img/pinball/20161118_142438.jpg">
[Hannah's Bar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hannah's+Bar+%26+Grille/@47.0438298,-122.9047795,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5491751c7ddc3537:0xd862733ff374141c!8m2!3d47.0438298!4d-122.9025908?hl=en) has Ghostbusters as the main feature with a few other arcade games. Bring lots of quarters to this one though, $1 per play!

## Eagen's
I haven't had a chance to go there yet but I hear Eagan's has a pinball.


## Go play!
Did I miss any pinballs in Olympia? If so, leave a comment so I can complete the list! 

Still not enough pinball for you? Take a trip to the [Seattle Pinball Museum](http://www.seattlepinballmuseum.com/). They have my favorite pinball there, Rocky & Bullwinkle! You can also download the Android app [Skill Shot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skillshot.android) which tries to map out the various pinball machines around Seattle.
